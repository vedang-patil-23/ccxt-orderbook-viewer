# CCXT Orderbook Viewer

This project is a simple, minimalistic web application for visualizing real-time order book data from various cryptocurrency exchanges using the CCXT library. It allows users to select an exchange, apply visual offsets, and view buy/sell order book charts for BTC/USDT. The frontend is built with React and Chart.js, while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and CCXT.

## What I Hoped to Learn

Through building this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of:
- Integrating real-time financial APIs (CCXT) with a modern web frontend
- Visualizing market data in a clear, interactive way
- Structuring a full-stack application with clean separation of concerns
- Handling live data and user-driven updates efficiently

## Exploring Fintech

This project is part of my ongoing exploration of the fintech sector. I am keen to learn more about how technology can empower financial analysis and trading, and I approach this journey with enthusiasm and curiosity. There is much to discover, and I am eager to continue building, experimenting, and growing my knowledge in this dynamic field.
